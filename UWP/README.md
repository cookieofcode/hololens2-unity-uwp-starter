# UWP

This folder contains the C# solution for faster development. Use the solution to try out the UWP API and implement against shared resources to use them in Unity.

The Holographic face tracking sample has been adapted (converted C++ to C#) from the Microsoft Windows-universal-samples repository. See their documentation on how to deploy the solution: https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/HolographicFaceTracking.

## Additional Remarks
The solution has been tested on a HoloLens 2 using `DEBUG|ARM64`.
